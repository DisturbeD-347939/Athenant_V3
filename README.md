## **Description**
Athenant is a web app which allows you to **search for someone's details** by only typing their **Twitter handle**.
It retrieves only public information available on the target's Twitter. With this information the app constructs a profile out of the person and tries to get information such as where the person is from, when is their birthday, etc.

The most important bit of this search is the graphs that come along with it, there are graphs displaying the **times of the day** a user in online, the **times of the week he's online** and even the **location** of where the user sends the tweets from. There's also a cloudword with the **most common used words** on the targets profile.

This project was created as an **artefact** to my **dissertation** at University. It's meant to show how much public information we have out in the Internet and how harmful it can be if used in the wrong hands.

This project is **finished**!
